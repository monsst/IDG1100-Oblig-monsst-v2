        24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints
        “Task scheduled at” + DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on
        today’s date (only today).
    </h3>
    <p>First you use the command crontab -e to make a cronjob.
        After that you add inn the time you want it to execute.
        In this example that would be */30 * 27 11 * . (This was written the 27th of November.)
        On the right side of that you add your command: echo "Task scheduled at $(date)."
        Continuing to the right you add where you want the text to be echoed to: >>
        /home/username/something/somthing.etc
        Then you save your cronjob, and exit.
        Now you should check if the cronjob is running: service cron status.
        Make sure that you give your cronjob the permissions it need with the chmod command.
        Now to make sure it is running you can write: service cron start.
        It should now work.</p>
    <h3>
        25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will
        display the answer of a question. The script should when started list a
        menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen and
        which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display
        the answer of the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user
        should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The menu should
        also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or
        nochanges is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch
        case to be able to handle the menu. Each option in the menu should lead to
        an echo of the answer
    </h3>
    <p>I have no idea how to solve this. (Something about if, elif and else statements)
